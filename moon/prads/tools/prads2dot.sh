# this version connects the nodes, it just sorts services to
# group them on a per-node basis, something like this:
#
# (localhost)---(samenet1)---(samenet2)---...---(samenetM)
#  |
# (hop1router[dummy])---(hop1.1)---(hop1.2)---...---(hop1.N)
#  |
# (hop2router[dummy])---(hop2.1)---(hop2.2)---...---(hop2.O)
#  |
# (hop3router[dummy])---(hop3.1)---(hop3.2)---...---(hop3.P)
#  |
#  ...
#  |
# (hopZrouter[dummy])---(hopZ.1)---(hopZ.2)---...---(hopZ.X)
#
# it generates a dot file, then use
# xdot to view it or
# dot to convert to image

#the general format for prads data is:
#asset,vlan,port,proto,service,[service-info],distance,discovered
#
### inside [service info] there is again "," !!!
### standby... temporarily solved by prads author
#
#1 asset       = The ip address of the asset.
#2 vlan        = The virtual lan tag of the asset.
#3 port        = The port number of the detected service.
#4 proto       = The protocol number of the matching fingerprint.
#5 service     = The "Service" detected, like: TCP-SERVICE, UDP-SERVICE, SYN, SYNACK,MAC,.....
#6 service-info= The fingerprint that the match was done on, with info.
#7 distance    = Distance based on guessed initial TTL (service = SYN/SYNACK)
#8 discovered  = The timestamp when the data was collected
